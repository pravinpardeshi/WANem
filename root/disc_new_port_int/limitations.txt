Disconnection status checks kicks every 1 second.
The timing may not be very accurate as it does not take into account the time taken for the status checks.
The error in timing is expected to be 1 second every 1000 seconds.

For Idle connection termination and Random connection termination currently only one direction of the connetion is blocked.
This is being worked upon to include both directions. However the current status may be considered good enough to bring out most application anomalies.

Testing has been done for one interface only. But it can work on multiple interfaces also.
